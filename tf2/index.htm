    <td>Allows you to repair your buildings from a distance without putting yourself at risk.<br>
      Being marked for death while carrying buildings doesn't matter much, since you'll only need to carry your dispenser a short distance through your base.<br>

    <td>Improves defense against Demoman and Soldier, which is a better bonus than any other available secondary weapon.

    <td>Melee
    <td>Less construction rate boosting from wrench hits doesn't really matter, since the difference is only a few seconds.<br>
      Less metal from dispensers and pickups doesn't matter, because you will not be near your dispenser when repairing your sentry.<br>
      You can quickly teleport back to your spawn or teleporter exit via a 2 second taunt.<br>
      Your teleporters cost less metal to build and upgrade.

  <tr>
    <td>Dispenser
    <td>600 healing
    <td>Deploy a level 3 dispenser in the lobby corner closest to the area below the grate.<br>
      Your dispenser will provide your team with ammo and healing at a fallback location and your team will protect your dispenser by preventing the enemy team from advancing.<br>
      You should move your dispenser forward to inside the dual main entrance fork if you have multiple Engineers or if your team has control of the bridge.
  <tr>
    <td>Sentry
    <td>1 kill,<br>2 assists
    <td>Deploy a level 3 sentry at the sweet spot facing towards the grate.<br>
      Your sentry will cover the battlements entrance, the top floor grate room entrance, part of the courtyard, and both entrances to the intelligence.<br>
      Your teammates will protect the sentry from enemies advancing via the courtyard as long as you keep your dispenser and teleporter up.
  <tr>
    <td>Teleporters
    <td>2 teleports not by you
    <td>Deploy a level 3 teleporter that goes from the corner of your primary resupply room entrance closest to the battlements to the lobby room with your dispenser.<br>
      The teleporter should be facing towards the direction one would go to leave via the main entrance to prevent players from becoming disoriented.<br>
      You can use this teleporter to place down a freshly constructed level 3 dispenser if your dispenser gets destroyed.<br>
      Other players using this teleport will learn about the dispenser they can run back to, and they will be available to defend your dispenser by preventing the enemy team from advancing.<br>
      You can repair the teleporter exit by repairing the teleporter entrance with your wrench. This can stall opposing players and cause them to expend additional ammo before retreating or moving on to attack the courtyard.
