      <li>Disenchant extra cards via the "Disenchant Extra Cards" button.
      <li>Disenchant Classic cards that have been changed in a recent balance patch, because they can be disenchanted for their full crafting cost. This can include golden versions if you still need a lot of dust.
      <li>If you don't have all non-Classic cards, disenchant non-golden extra Classic cards, which are displayed when you search for "extra classic", until you have 2 of that card total (or 1 for legendary cards). This can also include golden versions if you still need a lot of dust.
      <li>Craft non-golden wild cards starting with the most useful, because these cannot be obtained from packs that cost gold or monthly season endings.
      <li>Craft golden versions of cards that cannot be obtained otherwise, such as the Beckoner of Evil.
      <li>Craft golden wild cards starting with your favorites.
      <li>Save remaining dust for future card releases or craft golden standard cards.
    </ol>
