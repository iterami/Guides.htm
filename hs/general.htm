<ul>
  <li>Do not hover over or drag cards during play. Doing so provides your opponent with more information, including if your cards target specific targets or if you are familiar with card effects.
  <li>If you have extra mana to spare and doing so wouldn't cause a logical negative effect, use your hero power. Not using your hero power when you can tells your opponent that you do not have cards in your deck that benefit from your hero power usage count.
  <li>Not hovering over or mulliganing your leftmost card during the mulligan phase may make your opponent believe you are playing the quest of your class.
  <li>You can click on played cards that appear on the left side of the screen to reduce the delay before animations begin.
