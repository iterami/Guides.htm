Notes:
<ul>
  <li>Always recite a chant when you reach an Incantation Shrine. Prosperity chants should be your priority, followed by primary stat boosting.
  <li>Be careful when changing weapons or spells in your spell book, for your character will attack with the most recently changed weapon/spell unless you manually change back to which attack you prefer.
  <li>Builds, sorted easiest to hardest:<ol>

  <li>If you cannot pick up an item automatically, try picking it up with a click when your inventory is open.
  <li>If you need health or mana but don't have any potions, park your characters in a safe area and take a break to stretch your legs. Make sure your game isn't paused.
  <li>Spells are contained within spell books. If you are upgrading your spell book, make sure to move all the spells out first.
  <li>Spells that instantly hit an enemy without travel time can be fired through walls.
  <li>Statue Guardian: Azunai, Xeria, Elandir, Zaramoth. Get it wrong five times for additional boss monsters.
