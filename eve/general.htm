<ul>
  <li>Always have your skill training and science queues as full as possible.
  <li>Autopilot:<ul>
    <li>Initiate your first warp before enabling autopilot.
    <li>Never use autopilot when flying through low/null security space, when flying valuable ships, or when flying ships with valuable cargo.
  </ul>
  <li>Do not accept missions that you cannot complete before the Bonus Reward timer expires.
  <li>Drones should remain in the drone bay until they are needed to attack something.
  <li>Move your assets to a single system for easier management and tracking, unless strategic asset placement is required.
  <li>Keep ship price low when fitting:<ul>
    <li>Avoid social interactions that may lead to a bounty being placed on your head.
    <li>Keep your cargohold as empty as possible by dropping off acquired loot at a station.
    <li>Never fly special edition ships.
    <li>Only use tech 1 and tech 2 modules that you need. Compare variations to find the optimal choice.
  </ul>
  <li>The angle your camera is facing when you dock will be the same when you undock, despite any ship spinning you may do while docked.
  <li>Use energy weapons with tech 1 ammo to save ISK by never purchasing ammo.
  <li>You should stay next to your deployed Mobile Tractor Unit and scoop it once you are done using it. It can easily be destroyed by other players and award a killmail. Players shooting Mobile Tractor Units will only get suspect status.
</ul>
