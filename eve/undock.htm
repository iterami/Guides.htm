  <li>Players can bump you away from station docking range, so be careful when accepting duels or shooting ships that won't have criminal status for more than ~5 minutes.
  <li>Send a duel request to players that are self-destructing their capsules.
  <li>Set other campers to -5 or -10 to keep track of them and more easily notice targets and competition.
  <li>Set your weapon "Auto-Repeat" to off to avoid missed shots caused by failure to deactivate your weapon.
