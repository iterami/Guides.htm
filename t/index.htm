<ul>
  <li>Base Building:<ul>
    <li>Build a base at the initial spawn location, for you will return there when you load the world or die.
    <li>Put an object that you can move through, such as a platform, on the inside of your main entrance doors. This will prevent enemies from opening it from the outside.
    <li>Utilize the following items in every base:<ul>
      <li>Campfire: increased life regeneration.
      <li>Cooking Pot: crafting.
      <li>Glass Kiln: crafting.
      <li>Heavy Work Bench: crafting.
      <li>Work Bench: crafting.
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>Enable "UseExperimentalFeatures" to see and set world generation seeds. This allows you to scout ahead in disposable copies of your main world.
  <li>Entering a created world spawns you at the same spawn location as when it was first created, regardless of your location when you saved and exited.
  <li>Take your coins out of a chest and then put them back into the chest to properly stack coins without making additional stacks.
  <li>Your character's inventory remains constant, even when switching to different worlds. This results in unlimited of every resource, as long as you are willing to gather them in a different world.
  </ul>
