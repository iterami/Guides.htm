    <td>Morte will speak to you. Take the scalpel from the container by the western door. Kill the Zombie Worker that is holding the Preparation Room Key and pick it up.
    <td>Don't use Morte to fight the zombie, as his health does not automatically regenerate.
  <tr>
    <td>3
    <td>Open the door located at the western end of the room. Morte will speak to you again after you pass through.

    <td>Open the door at the northern end of the room. Open the next door at the northern end of the room. Open the next door at the northeastern end of the room. Open the next door at the eastern end of the room. Open the next door at the southern end of the room. Go up the stairs to the third floor.
    <td>You will return to the Mortuary later on, so you should not loot containers or speak to any NPCs.
  <tr>
    <td>5
    <td>Select control of only Morte. Head south along the wall until you get to the shelves next to the locked door in the southwest of the room. Pick up the key and open the locked door. Go down the stairs back to the second floor.
    <td>The dustmen are not able to speak directly to Morte, so you will be safe from getting caught.
  <tr>
    <td>6
    <td>Go down the stairs to the first floor. Speak to Soego. Tell him you are lost, then ask him to lead you out. He will unlock the door and let you leave the Mortuary.
    <td>If the Dustman Guards speak to you, ask them if there are any guides around that can direct visitors, then thank them and they will leave you alone.
